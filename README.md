## Sources, Methodology, Exceptions

New York Times cases/deaths data: https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data
Our "Daily New Cases" and "Daily New Deaths" values are calculated by taking the difference between the "cases"/"deaths" value of that day and the day before.

Testing data from The COVID Tracking project: https://covidtracking.com/about-data
